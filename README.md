# Password-generator
If you need a save Password, you can use this Password generator. You can select the lengh (Laenge), if you want lowercase letters (kleinbuchstaben) yes or no (j/n), capital letters yes or no (j/n), if you want numbers (Zahlen) yes or no (j/n) and if you want special signs yes or no (j/n).

# Password-generator new
An new Paswordgenerator that works with another generating system for the letters.
This new system generates more saver passwords, because the first passwordgenerator uses random and random don't uses udev random. That's why it is not cryptographic save.
The new Passwordgenerator uses this system.
